# nmap scanning

### nmap -sC -sV -v \<ip address>

most used scan. -sC is for default scripts. -sV is attempting to enumerate versions for services. -v is verbose

### nmap -p- -T5 -v \<ip address>

used to scan all ports (-p-). -T5 is used for fastest speed, options are -T0 to -T5. -v is verbose mode

### nmap -oN nmap.txt \<target IP>

used to run nmap scan and output scan to nmap.txt using -oN

### This scan worked really well

nmap -sC -sV -p- -T5 -v $IP -oN nmap.txt

used to scan all ports with default scripts, version enumeration, and saved output to file
